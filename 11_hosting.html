    // hosting is very imp in js interview and hosting is not declare in ecma script but it is consider by the developer and ask in interview

    // hosting: hosting meanm if you declare a variavle and print these variable before declaration and not give any error call host variable -->hosting 

    // in const & let case also undefine in memory phase but the js put into the temporal dead zone (give error before initilization) 
  
    // debugger
    console.log(a);
    // console.log(b);
    var a = "sitaram"
    // const b = 20

    // in function case they host properly and give output

    greet()
    // function declaration
    function greet(){
        console.log("nice to meet you ");
    }

    // function method 2 using variable 
    // in this using the varible we create function the function treated as a variable so in this give error not hosted 

    sayhi()
    // function expression
    const sayhi = function(){
        console.log("hello");
    }

    // in function , function expression and function declaration both are function definition we have 2 method for function definition 1.function declaration nd function expression 
    // so the function expression cannot host and function declaration can be host properly 

    // when we cannot give name to function call anonymous function (IIFE)
