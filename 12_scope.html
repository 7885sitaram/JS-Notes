    // in this in function if you create var but not use but show in debugger but function  not display without calling 

    // lexical scope : lexical scope mean inner function have own scope parents scope up to global scope call lexical scope in eg. grandchild acccs own value , child scope , subs scope up to global scope 

    // where you declare the variable without var let const they assign in window object and acces out side of function but this is not good practice so use "use strict" mode in js
